# Gilded Rose Solution 


## Approach

This section will outline my approach to refactoring the Gilded Rose Challenge. I first read through the original README (now oldREADME.md) and I also read through the links it provides to external resources. Following this I read through the outlined requirements and analsyed the src code accordingly.
My next step was to write test cases for the src code using jasmine and following this I went through a process of refactoring by creating new classes (i.e. for the item, the shop and each individual item described). I went through this process of refactoring/testing untill I was able to make as many tests work as possible.

## Instructions

```
