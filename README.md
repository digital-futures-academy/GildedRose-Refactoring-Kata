### Gilded Rose Refactoring Challenge

###### Introduction
This is a solution to the problem found at: https://github.com/digital-futures-academy/gilded-rose-refactoring-challenge. The behaviour of the items in the shop have been extracted into four individual classes, with additional classes to change the quality of the items, check that the item is valid and to model the behaviour of the shop.

###### Usage

To run this programme, clone it to your local machine and then use the command 'npm install' to install dependencies. After this, run 'npm test' to check that each class works as it should.
